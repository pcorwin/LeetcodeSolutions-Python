#Reverse Bits

#Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

#Note:

#Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type.
#In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type.
#They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation
#   is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
#In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation.
#Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and
#   the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.
